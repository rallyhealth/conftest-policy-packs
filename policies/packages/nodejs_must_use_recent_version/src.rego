# @title NodeJS Projects Must Use A Recent NodeJS Version
#
# NodeJS projects must use a recent NodeJS release.
# Only 1 LTS version is active at one time, however we allow 1 previous LTS version to be used to
# accomodate upgrade migration periods.
#
# You may use a non-LTS "current" NodeJS release as long as that version is more current than the most recently
# deprecated LTS release.
# For example, if the LTS version is 16 (meaning version 14 was the most recently deprecated LTS version),
# you may use NodeJS 14, 15, 16, or 17.
# Once NodeJS 18 is released as an LTS version, you may use versions 16, 17, 18, or 19.
#
# See <https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/> for more information about Node's release schedule.
#
# See <https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/configuring-npm/package-json#engines> for more information about the `engines`
# field in `package.json` files.
#
# | :memo: This policy is "online" in that it makes an HTTP request to raw.githubusercontent.com and requires connectivity to receive a response. |
