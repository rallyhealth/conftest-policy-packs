  NodeJS packages are subject to typosquatting, in which a malicious package is published
  with a slight misspelling. The aim is to infect end users who misspell your package.
  While this relies on end user misconfiguration, package owners can still take steps to reduce the viability
  of such a mistake.

  This can be avoided by scoping an organizational package beneath an organization scope.
  Organizations publishing packages to a private registry can use a private organization scope.
