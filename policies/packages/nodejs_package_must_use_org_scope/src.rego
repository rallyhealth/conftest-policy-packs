# @title NPM Packages Must Be Published Under An Organization Scope
#
# NodeJS packages are subject to typosquatting, in which a malicious package is published
# with a slight misspelling. The aim is to infect end users who misspell your package.
# While this relies on end user misconfiguration, package owners can still take steps to reduce the viability
# of such a mistake.
#
# This can be avoided by scoping an organizational package beneath an [organization scope](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/using-npm/scope).
# Organizations publishing packages to a private registry can use a private organization scope.
#
# Scopes are a way of grouping related packages together, and also affect a few things about the way npm treats the package.
# Each npm user/organization has their own scope, and only you can add packages in your scope.
# This means you don't have to worry about someone taking your package name ahead of you.
# Thus it is also a good way to signal official packages for organizations.
