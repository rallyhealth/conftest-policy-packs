description: |
  S3 Block Public Access ensures that objects in a bucket never have public access, now and in the future.
  S3 Block Public Access settings override S3 permissions that allow public access.

  Unintentionally exposed S3 Buckets are a frequent source of data breaches and restricting public access helps prevent unintended data exposure.
