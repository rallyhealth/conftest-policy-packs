  OPA Conftest policies enforcing security standards against Terraform.

  Notably, these policies support Terraform source code vs. rendered plan JSON, for CI support early in the developer workflow.

  The following policies are defined:
  
  - `AWSSEC-0001`: Encrypt S3 Buckets
  - `AWSSEC-0002`: EC2 Instances Must Use Instance Metadata Service Version 2
  - `AWSSEC-0003`: RDS Instances May Not Be Public
  - `AWSSEC-0004`: Block Public Access of S3 Buckets
install: |
  `conftest pull git::https://github.com/rallyhealth/conftest-policy-packs.git//policies`

  And configure your org-specific `--data` as necessary from [data/](https://github.com/rallyhealth/conftest-policy-packs/tree/main/data),
